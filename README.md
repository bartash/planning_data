Data is from  [Assessor Historical Secured Property Tax Rolls | City and County of San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Assessor-Historical-Secured-Property-Tax-Rolls/wv5m-vpq2).
The underlying data is unreliable, for example there are buildings with 100 stories, so take these maps as indicative. The main data file is too big for github so is not included here.
